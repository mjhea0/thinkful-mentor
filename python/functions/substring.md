## Substring

### Problem

Write a function, called `substring()`, that takes two strings as arguments and returns `True` when the first string is a substring of the second one - that is, when all of the characters in the first string occur contiguously in the second string.

### Strategy

1. Break down the problem with a pen and paper. Think about all the different conditions that checked.
2. Turn your words, pictures, diagrams into pseudo-code.
